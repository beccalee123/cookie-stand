		Pat's Salmon Cookies are the world's first cookies that are both shaped like AND flavored with salmon. The salmon is finely ground so you get all the protein and none of the fishy flavor. They're perfect with a cup of coffee on a cold rainy day and the fun fishy shape will help put a smile on your face. Once you try one, you'll be a fan for life!

	<h3 id="our-story">Our Story</h3>
	<img src="../img/family.jpg" alt="Pat & Family" />
	<p>
		Pat's Salmon Cookies was founded in 2016 and was borne out of Pat's desire for a delicious coffee-time treat that provided a healthy dose of protein. As he was visiting the Ballard Locks with his family (pictured above) and watching salmon jump up the fish ladder, he got a great idea: salmon cookies! At first he was intrigued by the cute shape, but it soon dawned on him that if he ground the salmon up finely enough, he could add it to the cookies to get a great boost of protein and omega 3 fatty acids without any of the fishy flavor. And thus, Pat's Salmon Cookies were born!
